        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This delicious recipe is made <strong>not</strong> with deep frying, but with an air fryer. Only being a bit denser in texture, they're perfect for other dishes as a side!</p>
        <p>Can be served with fried shrimp, or fried fish - or they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
